# snolte26 Tools
Various Python tools that don't deserve their own repo

----------------------------------

## Background
Over the years, I have made some small tools that aren't that special and don't really deserve their own repositories. Despite this, I ended up having a repo for each tool or script I made, junking up my repo list along with school assignments. 

I finally took some time to organize these different scripts and tools so that they can all exist in one single repository, and I can add new tools to here in the future. 

Here you will find general tools, miscellaneous scripts/tools, and stupid scripts that are mostly for gits and shiggles, or they don't fit anywhere else. Where applicable, different scripts and tools will have their own `README.md`
