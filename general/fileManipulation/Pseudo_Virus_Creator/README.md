# BatchBombCreator
Creates a batch bomb to use whenever.

This is an older program I made early 2020. Finally wanted to give it a home.
Originally, I called it a Pseudo Virus Creator, so please bear with that.
Heres the original README I made for it, censoring my last name:

	How to use: 
		Simply run the python script as is, and follow the prompts on the screen. 
	  This will create the pseudo virus within the same directory as the script. 
	  What you do with the created file is up to you, but I am not responsible for the consequences. 

	How it works:
		When ran, the script will create a new text document titled "cool_thing.txt". 
	  It will then open and write to the file the word "start" for 1000000 lines. 
	  Afterwards, it will convert the text file into a batch file.

	What the .bat file does:
		When opened, the .bat file begin to open more and more command line prompts. 
	  After a certain amount opened prompts, the computer will be overloaded and crash. 
	  Placing this file in the startup folder will make the computer constantly crash on startup
