# SiteConnectivityChecker
Check if you can Connect to a Site

Honestly, I was bored and haven't made anything in a while, so I made this

Very simple to operate, you input a website to check if its up, and it tries
to ping it. if it succeeds, you should be able to reach it. If it fails, then 
either you have connectivity issues, or the site is down
