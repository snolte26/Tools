Checks to make sure you are still connected to the internet

A bot that runs in the background and checks to make sure you are connected to
the internet. The bot checks every 5 seconds if you are connected to the internet. 

The bot will play an alert sound effect to alert you if you are disconnected from the 
internet, then wait for 30 seconds before trying again as you try to reconnect to the
internet.

If you chose to use this bot for personal uses, you will need to provide your own 
alerting sound effect file, as long as it makes a recognizable noise. 

Be sure that the mp3 file being used for the alert noise is in the same directory 
as the bot. 

On line 25, you will need to change the name to whatever your mp3 file is called.

# SOUND EFFECT MUST BE IN MP3 FORMAT!
